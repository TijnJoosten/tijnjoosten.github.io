# To Do

These are all the features I want to add to this site. <br>
I hope by adding this list, I will motivate myself to actually do it as it adds some peer pressure (but we will find out if it works).

To Do:
- Add custom Domain
- Finish the education page
  - add information about my university education
  - add information about my thesis
  - add information about my pre-university education
  - add information about my extracurricular education
- Add career information
- Add information about my personal hobbies/projects (e.g., bug bounties/programming)
- Add a custom layout with css/html
