        <h2>General Information</h2>
        
        My name is Tijn Joosten. As of now, I am a student at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Currently, I am following the Master 'Cyber Security', but next year I am thinking about switching to the Master 'AI and Cyber Security'. This is due to the fact that I have already completed a Bachelors in AI, meaning that this Master simply fits better to my interests and knowledge. <br>
        Apart from studying, my main hobbies can be found on my PC. I spend almost all my time on it, mainly playing games or programming random things.

        <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        If you would like to get into contact with me, the best option would be to message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tijnjoosten/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> <br> 
        You can also send me an email, but I will likely think it is spam if I don't recognize your name.
