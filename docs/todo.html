  These are all the features I want to add to this site.
  I hope by adding this list, I will motivate myself to actually do it as it adds some peer pressure (but we will find out if it works).
  
  <div id="todo">
    To Do:
    - Add custom Domain
    - Finish the education page
      - add information about my university education
      - add information about my thesis
      - add information about my pre-university education
      - add information about my extracurricular education
    - Add career information
    - Add information about my personal hobbies/projects (e.g., bug bounties/programming)
    - Add a custom layout with css/html
