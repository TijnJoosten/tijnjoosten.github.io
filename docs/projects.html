    Just like most computer scientists, I have many personal projects that I will definitely maybe finish some day.
    You can find some of these projects on my <a href="https://github.com/TijnJoosten" target="_blank">Github</a>, but I will give an overview of some noteworthy projects on this page.
    
    <div id="Website">
        <h2>Website</h2>
        At this moment, you are actually looking at one of my projects! It is this website!
        At the beginning, I wanted to write this page completely by hand using html, css and a python backend. However, this became to much of a hassle which is why I switched to Github Pages.
        The original project can still be found <a href="https://github.com/TijnJoosten/website" target="_blank">here</a>, but it should be noted that this has not been touched in a long time and was never really something to look at from the start. The current website using Github Pages contains a lot more information, and can actually be viewed online. the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/TijnJoosten/tijnjoosten.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
        I still want to rewrite this page using html and css instead of markdown as it seems really fun and interesting to get into. But for now, I will take the easy route and make sure I show something to the public first.

    <div id="SnakeGame">
        While doing my AI Bachelor, I had to work a lot with reinforcement learning and path finding algorithms. These concepts can easily be applied to a game, where a character has to find or learn the best path. <br>
        I tried to apply these concepts using the game Snake. The goal was to recreate the game such that I could place some agents in the world that would determine or learn the optimal route. The project is not finished yet, but at this point the main framework is there. I added different kinds of snakes that act upon the world differently. In the end, I want to add some more snakes that can play the game perfectly on their own. 
        My idea was to also add this to the python backend of my original website, but that won't  be an option anymore since that project has failed. I also don't think it will work with Github Pages.
        The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/TijnJoosten/snake_game" target="_blank">here</a>. It should be noted that this does give a good representation of how I program in Python. It shows my general coding style and documentation.
