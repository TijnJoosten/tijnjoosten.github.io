### Big Data
My first experience with Github Pages came from the course 'Big Data' I followed in my Bachelor's. You can read everything about it <a href="https://rubigdata.github.io/bigdata-blog-2021-TijnJoosten/" target="_blank">here</a>, that is as long as the university keeps the page online. For the course, I had to make multiple assignments and one final project regarding big data. The main topics where about the use of Spark and Scala and how they could be used to manage and analyse large amount of data. All the work was tracked by creating blogposts on GitHub Pages.
